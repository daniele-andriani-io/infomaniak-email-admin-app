# Infomaniak emailadmin app

The goal of this application is to allow any user to easily administrate their mailboxes within the
Infomaniak ecosystem.

## List of improvements I would like to add in the future

* show what address we're adding an alias too in the AppBar
* give the option to add a description to an alias to know for which service/website it has been used
* add the option to generate a random name alias
* add the option to create new email address

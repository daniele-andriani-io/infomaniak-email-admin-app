# Infomaniak emailadmin app

The goal of this application is to allow any user to easily administrate their mailboxes within the
Infomaniak ecosystem.

## List of improvements I would like to add in the future

* give the option to add a description to an alias to know for which service/website it has been used
* create AdSense account
* add email usage counter
* add widget tests?
* add integration tests?
* refactor
* in-app purchase for a bigger help
* tablet version of the application
